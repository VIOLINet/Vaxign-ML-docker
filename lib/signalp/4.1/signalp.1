.SH DESCRIPTION
.B signalp
predicts the presence and location of signal peptide cleavage sites in amino
acid sequences from different organisms: Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative
bacteria, and eukaryotes. The method incorporates a prediction of cleavage
sites and a signal peptide/non-signal peptide prediction based on a combination
of several artificial neural networks. Two types of neural networks have been
trained: SignalP-noTM and SignalP-TM, where SignalP-noTM is most similar to the
previous version of SignalP (ver 3.0) whereas the SignalP-TM method was trained
specifically to discriminate between a signal peptide and an N-terminal
transmembrane region. Predictions are made by both methods and the default
behaviour is to choose the most likely prediction. It is however possible to
specifically choose SignalP-noTM predictions to keep a functionality where the
user believes that submitted sequences do not include a transmembrane region.

To run SignalP 4.1 in the "sensitive" mode which has the same
sensitivity as SignalP 3.0, the user has to specify D-score cutoff
values. See the \fB-u\fP and \fB-U\fP options, below.

The method is described in detail in the references quoted below.

.B Input

The input is taken from \fIfile\fP or, if no file is specified, the standard
input. The input format, described below, is Pearson \fBFASTA\fP (see CAVEATS
below). Several input
files may be specified on the same command line.

Each sequence must be preceded by a sequence header line starting with the
symbol `>' immediately followed by a unique name (identifier) of the
sequence. The rest of the header line, separated from the name by whitespace,
is ignored. The sequences must be written using the one letter abbreviations
for the amino acids:

     \fBacdefghiklmnpqrstvwy\fP or \fBACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY\fP

Other letters and digits will be converted to `X' and treated as
unknown amino acids. Other characters like blanks will be ignored.

By default, only the first 70 N-terminal amino acids are used for predictions.	

.B Output

For each input sequence, signalp will return three scores between 0 and 1 for
each sequence position (depending on choice of output format):

.B C-score
(raw cleavage site score)
     The output score from networks trained to recognize
     cleavage sites vs. other sequence positions. Trained to
     be high at position +1 (immediately after the cleavage
     site), and low at all other positions.

.B S-score
(signal peptide score)
     The output score from networks trained to recognize
     signal peptide vs. non-signal-peptide positions.
     Trained to be high at all positions before the cleavage
     site, and low at positions after the cleavage site and
     in the N-terminals of non-secretory proteins.

.B Y-score
(combined cleavage site score)
     The prediction of cleavage site location is optimized
     by observing where the C-score is high and the S-score
     changes from a high to a low value.  The Y-score
     formalizes this by combining the height of the C-score
     with the slope of the S-score.

.in +5n
Specifically, the Y-score is a geometric average between the C-score and a
smoothed derivative of the S-score (i.e. the difference between the mean
S-score over \fId\fP positions before and \fId\fP positions after the current
position, where \fId\fP varies with the chosen network ensemble).
.in -5n

.B signalp
will then report the maximal C-, S-, and Y- scores, the mean S-score in the
interval between the N-terminal and the site with the maximal Y-score and,
finally, the D-score, a weighted average of the S-mean and Y-max score. The
final, combined prediction of the presence of a signal peptide in the sequence
is based on the D-score.

The high detail level of the output is intended to allow for interpretation
of borderline cases by the user.

If the sequence is predicted to have a signal peptide, the predicted cleavage
site is located immediately before the position with the maximal Y-score.

Write predictions for both Signalp-TM and SignalP-noTM networks. Five columns
with cleavage site (CS) and Signal Peptide (SP) predictions for both SigP-noTM
and SigP-TM methods and TM prediction for each position.

.SH CAVEATS

If
.B SignalP
is used with graphics, the
.B FASTA
sequence names (i.e. everything between the '>' character and the first white
space on the header line)
are used to generate file names. This will, under any operating system, go
wrong and generate error messages if the following characters are included
in the
.B FASTA
sequence names:

     "   /   \\

Under Windows, we additionally recommend avoiding the following characters in 
.B FASTA
sequence names when using graphics:

     *   :   <   >   ?   |

They will work locally under Cygwin or MobaXterm, but may produce files that
cannot be opened by other Windows programs outside of Cygwin or MobaXterm.
